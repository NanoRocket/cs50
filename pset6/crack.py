# Desc: This program cracks the given password (hashed with Câ€™s DES-based 
#       (not MD5-based) crypt function), assuming password is no longer than 4
#       alphabetical characters
# Usage: gives an argument to be dehashed
# File Dependencies: 
# Subfunctions: 


# get hashed password view command line

# crack hashed password
# assumed hashed with crypt module
# crypt.crypt(word, salt)
# assume only 4 characters loong and alphabetical
