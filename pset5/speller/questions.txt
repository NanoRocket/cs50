0.  What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?

lung disease caused by silica dust. Or an organization pandering for relevance.

1.  According to its man page, what does getrusage do?

int getrusage(int who, struct rusage *usage);
getrusage() returns resource usage measures for who, which can be one of the following:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?

16

3.  Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to 
    calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?

It is much faster to pass large data structures by reference instead of by value

4.  Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes 
    about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed
    understand how that function’s for loop works.

We open the file and start with the first word of the text. We will move character by character
until we reach the EOF marker. We then first check that there are only alphabetical 
characters and apostrophes in the word (as long as apostrophe after 0). We add that
character to the word. If index is larger than the largest word we know, we skip the remainder of that 
string. If there are numbers in the word, we ignore that word. Else, we have found an entire word
so we record that we have and check the spelling.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time 
    rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? 
    Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?

We could get punctuation included in the words if we read by string.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const 
    (which means "constant")?

That way when we interact with the file and dictionary, we can not change them.

const char*
is a mutable pointer to an immutable character/string. You cannot change the contents of the 
location(s) this pointer points to. Also, compilers are required to give error messages when you try 
to do so. For the same reason, conversion from const char * to char* is deprecated.

char* const
is an immutable pointer (it cannot point to anyother location) but the contents of location at 
which it points are mutable.

const char* const
is an immutable pointer to an immutable character/string.

char*
is entirely permissive.
